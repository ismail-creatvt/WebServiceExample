Hi!,
I am Ismail, I have just started to explore android app development. This is my first repository on github (hurray!).
As far as this application is concerned, It is pretty basic one. just a beginner level, totally academic.
It consists of two parts
1. Movie Details (Actually its not movie but superheroes)
    It first shows a recycler view showing a small list of superheroes with some details. when you click any recyclerview item it shows a new activity with more details about the hero you just clicked. Thats It.
    
2. Google Api
    It takes the source and destination as input with a travel mode and displays the distance and duration of travel.
    
P.S I have used material design components like cardview, TextInputLayout,TextInputEditText as Google is so enthusiastic about material and personally I am also starting to love material.
